# Walkable: To Uber or not to Uber? 

This project spawned initially while walking around Boston at night, and wondering if the area I was going into was safe, or if it would be better to just Uber back home. This is especially true for girls, who understably, may feel dramatically less safe, while alone. In other words, it presented a good excuse to build out a full-stack web application.
