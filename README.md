# Walkable: To Uber or not to Uber? 

It's late at night, you need to get home. Should you walk home, or Uber home? How sketchy is the area I'm in truly? 

This is an important question, especially for women, who understably, may feel less safe while walking alone at night. In other words, it presented a good excuse to build out a full-stack web application. 

The tech-stack for this application is React.js for frontend, Node.js/Express.js/PostgreSQL (with PostGIS Extension) for backend. I used postico briefly for PostgreSQL visualization.
